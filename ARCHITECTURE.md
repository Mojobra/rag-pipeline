## Current Generation Contract

- LangChain composes the `grounded-v2` prompt with the configured language model
  and string output parser.
- Ranked chunks are packed into numbered evidence blocks under exact character
  and tokenizer limits.
- Retrieved text is explicitly treated as untrusted data, and unsupported or
  conflicting evidence maps to one deterministic abstention response.
- The answer result records both model and prompt identifiers; source citations
  are constructed outside the language model from validated chunk provenance.

Evidence delimiters are prompt structure, not a security or authorization
boundary. Answer faithfulness and abstention still require dataset-based
evaluation before production use.

## Current Retrieval Evaluation Contract

- A strict schema-v1 JSON file supplies named query cases and one or more binary
  relevance judgments expressed as exact document-metadata selectors.
- Evaluation runs the same LangChain/Qdrant dense or hybrid retriever, metadata
  filters, score gate, and optional cross-encoder reranker used by interactive
  commands; it never invokes generation or mutates the collection.
- Reports include per-case Hit@k, Precision@k, Recall@k, and reciprocal rank,
  plus macro averages that give every query equal weight.
- Table output supports local diagnosis and JSON output supports saved
  comparisons. Representative datasets, answer evaluation, latency capture,
  and benchmark manifests remain later Phase 3 work.

Exact metadata selectors are transparent but depend on stable provenance.
Portable business datasets should eventually use immutable document and chunk
version identifiers instead of absolute local source paths.
